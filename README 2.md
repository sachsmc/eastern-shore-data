# The Perfect Foundation Stack

This is a template for your next web project using Foundation, Grunt, Libsass, and Assemble!

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `sudo npm install -g bower`

## Quickstart

Clone this repository:
`git clone git@github.com:zurb/foundation-libsass-template.git`

Navigate into the directory:
`cd foundation-libsass-template`

Install all the dependincies:

While you're working on your project, run:

This will assemble all the pages and compile the Sass. You're set!

## Directory Structure

* `dist`: Static pages are assembled here. This is where you should view the site in your browser. **Don't edit these files directly. They will be overwritten!**
* `src`: This is the directory you'll work in. 
* `src/assets`: All assets (scss, images, fonts, js, etc) go here.
* `src/assets/scss/_settings.scss`: Foundation configuration settings go in here
* `src/assets/scss/app.scss`: Application styles go here
